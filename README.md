# Mathematical-Arts
This repository contains three MATLAB program files: wheels-on-wheels-on-wheels.m, walpapers.m, and BesselWaveApp.m. Each generates a GUI where users can interactively experiment with different parameter choices for the corresponding mathematical object. It also contains some artistic results generated by these programs.
Details can be found in the README file provided.
