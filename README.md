# Mathematical-Arts
This repository contains three MATLAB program files: wheels-on-wheels-on-wheels.m, walpapers.m, and BesselWaveApp.m. Each generates a GUI where users can interactively experiment with different parameter choices for the corresponding mathematical object. It also contains some artistic results generated by these programs. The codes and images are all part of a summer research project. Details of each program can be found at the beginning of each code file. 
For BesselArtCollections, the images uploaded contains both the images exported from MATLAB .fig file and those rendered from Rhino Grasshopper 3D. The Rhino images use the colormap exported from MATLAB.
