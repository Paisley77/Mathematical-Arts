This repository contains three MATLAB program files: wheels-on-wheels-on-wheels.m, walpapers.m, and BesselWaveApp.m. Each generates a GUI where users can interactively experiment with different parameter choices for the corresponding mathematical object. It also contains some artistic results. generated by these programs.
